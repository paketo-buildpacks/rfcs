# Self-host our blog via Hugo and GitHub Pages

## Summary

Create our own self-hosted blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosting
via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Motivation

The current blog uses Medium as its publishing platform. This has some obvious
benefits, and also a few drawbacks. The benefits include a nicely themed blog
layout and links to share posts on social networks. Some of the drawbacks
include requiring that authors signup for a Medium account and possibly seeing
our posts get placed behind a "login wall" when folks read too many posts on
Medium. Hosting our own blog removes these drawbacks and makes the post
creation process much more open. Additionally, it allows us full control over
the look and feel of the blog site.

## Detailed Explanation

Using Hugo, we can easily create a blogging platform that uses a post format
that we are already familiar with, Markdown. We will get fine-grained control
of the styling and features of the platform and can tailor it to our specific
needs. Additionally, Hugo handles the vast majority of the complexity and makes
hosting a blog like ours very simple.

Here is an example of what our own blog could look like. As you can see, it
more clearly aligns with the styling of the main website.

Once the blog is created and made available as a repo in the
[`paketo-buildpacks` GitHub org](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks), we can
start to host it on GitHub Pages. Hosting there is free and deployment is
straightforward. It even allows us to use a custom domain like
`blog.paketo.io`. We already use GitHub Pages to host the [main
website](https://paketo.io) and our [dashboard](https://dashboard.paketo.io).

We can also include some of the social media features that were present on
Medium. It is relatively straight-forward to include "share buttons" for the
major social networks that allow readers to share our posts. Here is what that
might look like.

## Rationale and Alternatives

We could continue to use Medium, but its benefits over this proposal are quite
marginal.

## Implementation

1. Create a new `blog` repository under the existing `Content` subteam.
1. Develop the look and feel of the blog using Hugo.
1. Copy over the existing posts currently hosted on Medium.
1. Deploy the blog using GitHub pages at `blog.paketo.io`.
1. Link to the new blog from the main Paketo website.

## Prior Art

Existing self-hosted sites:
1. [paketo.io](https://paketo.io)
1. [dashboard.paketo.io](https://dashboard.paketo.io).

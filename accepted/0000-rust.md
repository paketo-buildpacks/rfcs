# Paketo Community Rust Buildpack

## Summary

A [Rust Cloud Native Buildpack](https://github.com/dmikusa/rust-cnb) for building Rust applications has been created by [@dmikusa][@dmikusa]. It is built using common tooling used by the Paketo Buildpacks project and should be adopted into the Paketo Community Github Org.

## Motivation

We would like to move the Rust CNB into the Paketo Community so that the community can use it to build Rust applications. This will also give the buildpack maintainer the ability to leverage common Paketo tooling to keep the buildpack dependencies updated and release the buildpack.

## Implementation

The Rust Buildpacks will be moved into the `paketo-community` Github organization and a new Rust sub-team will be created. Initial maintainer for this team will be [@dmikusa][@dmikusa].

The following changes will be made:
- [Rust CNB](https://github.com/dmikusa/rust-cnb) moved to Paketo Community
- [Rust Dist CNB](https://github.com/dmikusa/rust-dist-cnb) moved to Paketo Community
- [Rust Cargo CNB](https://github.com/dmikusa/rust-cargo-cnb) moved to Paketo Community
- All buildpacks will have `paketo-community/<buildpack>` ID
- Buildpack will be published to `gcr.io/paketo-community/rust`

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding

**Eventually** the Core Dependencies team should publish the Rust dependency so that the Rust team can consume it from the dependency server to provide dependency updates.

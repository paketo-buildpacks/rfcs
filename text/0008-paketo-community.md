# Paketo Community

## Summary

The Paketo Community is a place where trusted community created buildpacks can be hosted. This would provide users a trusted place to search for buildpacks.

## Motivation

There are two point why this community should exist.

The Paketo Community will allow for the testing of new technologies or the development of buildpacks in an environment that is more flexible than that of the core Paketo.

A trusted repository of community buildpacks will also allow for a trusted source of buildpacks that solve common yet still relatively niche problems that are not suitable to be added to core Paketo.

## Detailed Explanation

A trusted project is a defined by the following:
- The project must be actively maintained (i.e. issues and pull requests must be addressed regularly, approved pull requests must be merged or updated in a timely manner, etc.).
- There must be visible automated testing for all repositories that are part of the project.
- The project maintainers must conform to a set of best effort SLOs around patching critical CVEs when applicable to the project.

This definition of trusted is meant to alleviate the following problems:
1. There must be a defined system in place to reap abandonware.
1. All repositories must meet some testing standard to be trusted in order to ensure that the projects support the latest Paketo technologies and platforms.
1. If a project maintainers are not making a best effort of patching out or updating vulnerable software then the project as a whole is untrustworthy.

The maintainers must also be willing to sign the project over to the Cloud Foundry Foundation and conform to the licensing of the requirements laid out by the Cloud Foundry Foundation.

## Implementation

For a new project to be added to the Paketo Community organization, it must conform to the standard of what it means to be a trusted project. Then the maintainers of the project may open a proposal for their project to be added to the Paketo Community organization. If this proposal gets sponsored by at least two maintainers of the Paketo project then the project may be merged into the Paketo Community organization. The responsibility of the maintainers that sponsored the project is to ensure that the project continues to meet the requirements of a trusted project and if it fails to meet that standard to remove it from the Paketo Community organization.

## Future Art

Have a build process that is controlled by the Paketo project that will allow for the compilation to all Paketo and Paketo Community artifacts to ensure the security of the artifacts.

# Codify the Creation of New Maintainer Groups

## Summary

This RFC is intended to define processes for the creation of new maintainer groups.

## Motivation

Currently the creation of new maintainer groups is an ad hoc process that has to be hashed out every time a new group is requested. This means that intervention from the Steering Committee is often needed in situations where they should not need to weigh in. It also means that there is no standard record for the introduction of new groups meaning that the reasoning behind the formation of these new maintainer groups is lost. Codifying this process should make it easier to identify when new maintainer groups should be formed and make the process of doing so much easier. It should also give approval power to the stakeholders that will be directly affected by the introduction of new maintainer groups, namely the existing maintainer groups as opposed to the Steering Committee.

## Implementation

The following are the 3 scenarios in which a new maintainer group would be formed and the procedures for forming each group type.

### New Maintainer Group for New Repositories
When proposing a new project that the proposer feels does not fall under the domain of an existing maintainer group they can suggest creating a new maintainer group. As part of the proposal, members of the initial maintainer group should be suggested or a request for volunteers should be open by the proposer of the new project. A new group must have sufficient membership to be considered. The group and the proposed initial set of members will then be reviewed and either approved or rejected by the Steering Committee.

### New Maintainer Group for Existing Repositories that are Maintained by One Existing Group
When the repositories exist and are already under the control of an existing maintainer team but there is a desire to have a new maintainer group take over or co-maintain a portion of the existing repositories. The process will involve opening a proposal to create a new maintainer group and outline the motivation for creating a new maintainer group and which repositories this new maintainer group would become responsible for. As part of the proposal, members of the initial maintainer group should be suggested or a request for volunteers should be open. Then the current maintainers will have to vote on whether or not they want to either cede/share control over the repositories proposed and whether or not the maintainers proposed are suitable.

### New Maintainer Group for Covering Repositories that Cross Maintainer Groups
When a project that requires coordination of components across multiple repositories that fall under the responsibility of existing maintainer groups but there are people that would like to be able to maintain the project as a whole.The process will involve opening a proposal to create a new maintainer group and outline the motivation for creating a new maintainer group and which repositories this new maintainer group would become responsible for. As part of the proposal, members of the initial maintainer group should be suggested or a request for volunteers should be open. Then the steering committee and current maintainers of all repositories that are part of the proposal will have to vote on whether or not they want to share control over the repositories proposed and whether or not the maintainers proposed are suitable.

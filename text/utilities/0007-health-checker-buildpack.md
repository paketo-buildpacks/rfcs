# Health Checker Support

## Summary

Introduce a Health Checker buildpack. This buildpack will provide access to one or more health checkers, where a health checker is a small binary that will be installed into the container image for the purpose of validating the health of the runnning image.

By default, we'll provide a tiny HTTP health checker which can be used to probe a port and path. An HTTP 200 OK response returns exit code 0 and a non-2xx response returns 1.

The Health Checker buildpack would be maintained by the existing [Utilities team](https://github.com/orgs/paketo-buildpacks/teams/utilities). It uses libpak & libcnb.

## Motivation

When running buildpack generated images on Kubernetes, HTTP-based health checking is provided by the platform. When running your buildpack generated images with Docker or Docker Compose, there is no option for HTTP-based health checks. It requires a binary in the image to perform the HTTP operation. This is typically `curl` or `wget`, however, the Paketo tiny and base images do not include these binaries.

Having a buildpack that installs a health checker allows for HTTP-based health checks when running on Docker. In addition, it could allow for other types of health checkers for example if your application does not use HTTP.

## Detailed Explanation

1. A health checker buildpack has been developed. It will be contributed to Paketo.
   1. By default, no health checker will be installed by the buildpack.
   2. If a user sets `BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_ENABLED=true` then the buildpack will detect and contribute a health check binary to the `$PATH`.
   3. A process type of `health-check` will be contributed with the command to run the health checker. This may be invoked by the user rather than needing the full command.

## Rationale and Alternatives

1. A user can create a custom stack and include a tool like `curl` or `wget`. This is a lot of additional work, plus `curl` and `wget` are overkill for a simple HTTP health check. To reduce footprint, they are not recommended.

## Implementation

The new Health Checker buildpack will participate if either of the following conditions are met

* A user sets `BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_ENABLED=true`
* An upstream buildpack requests `hc` in the build plan.

When conditions are met, the buildpack will do the following:

* Contributes a health checker to a layer marked `launch` with command on `$PATH`
* Contributes a process type called `health-check` which will execute the installed health checker.
  * If any known environment variables for [supported health checkers](#default-health-checker) are set at build time, they will be set as process specific environment variables on the `health-check` process type at the `.default` level.

The Health Checker buildpack will optionally be added to the language family buildpacks that wish to include support for it. The primary targets will be the Java and Rust buildpacks. The buildpack should be added reasonably close to the end of an order group for a given language family.

Other buildpacks in the order group may influence the configuration of the the health checker by modifying the `BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_DEPENDENCY` or health checker specific environment variables. It is recommended that buildpacks use the `.default` setting when doing this so that any user specified options will have the highest precedence.

The following configuration options will be available to the buildpack.

| Environment Variable            | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_ENABLED`    | If set to `true` the buildpack will contribute a health checker binary. Defaults to `false`, so no health checker is contributed. |
| `$BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_DEPENDENCY` | The dependency id in `buildpack.toml` of the health checker to install.                                                           |

#### Default Health Checker

The default health checker that we'll support initially is [tiny-health-checker](https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/tiny-health-checker). This has support for minimal HTTP GET health checks. It only allows health checks to `localhost`, but does support a configurable port and path. This is intentional to prohibit it from being used to exfiltrate data in a compromised container. All configuration of the health checker is done via environment variables.

Full usage:

```
USAGE:
	thc

ENV:

    THC_PORT sets the port to which a connection will be made, default: 8080
    THC_PATH sets the path to which a connection will be made, default `/`
    THC_CONN_TIMEOUT sets the connection timeout, default: 10
    THC_REQ_TIMEOUT sets the request timeout, defaults: 15

	**NOTE** Host is not configurable and will always be `localhost`
```

### Example

A user can then utilize the health checker like this:

1. For a Spring Boot app, run `pack build apps/maven -p target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -b paketo-buildpacks/java -b docker.io/paketo-buildpacks/health-checker -e BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_ENABLED=true -e THC_PORT='8080' -e THC_PATH='/actuator/health'` (it won't be necessary to include the `-b` arguments once the buildpack has been integrated with language family buildpacks). You'll see output like this at the end. It's installing the health checker and setting a process type.

    ```
    Paketo Health Checker Buildpack vDEVELOPMENT
      https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/health-checker
      Build Configuration:
        $BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_DEPENDENCY  thc                    which health checker to contribute
        $BP_HEALTH_CHECKER_ENABLED     true                   contributes a health checker if enabled
      Tiny Health Checker 0.5.0: Contributing to layer
        Downloading from https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/tiny-health-checker/releases/download/v0.5.0/thc-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
        Verifying checksum
        Copying from /tmp/ce75bb97209981e03bf7e8aa52e2bfab78a50a44c7ed1787f4ace212711d61e5/thc-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl to /layers/paketo-buildpacks_health-checker/thc/bin
        Writing env.launch/health/THC_PATH.default
        Writing env.launch/health/THC_PORT.default
      Process types:
    health-check: thc (direct)
    ```

2. You can run this with `docker run --health-cmd 'health' --health-interval 5s --health-timeout 2s -it apps/maven`. You could call the health check binary directly, but as you can have different health check dependencies that get installed by the buildpack, using the process type gives you more generic way to call the health check. It also allows for the image to bake in the health check configuration, rather than require the operator to set it. Plus, an operator can always override the configuration by setting the appropriate environment variables at runtime.

# Dependency Mappings

## Summary

We should provide a standard mechanism for mapping dependencies to new URIs that works across all Paketo buildpacks.

## Motivation

Consumers of Paketo buildpacks may be building in an environment where certain dependency URIs are inaccessible (due to restrictive firewall rules for example). Operators may want host copies of certain dependencies at different accessible URIs.

## Detailed Explanation

### Discovery
If one or more bindings of kind or type `dependency-mapping` are present, then
a buildpack should use the bindings in its dependency resolution process. The
dependency's digest, included as `checksum` in the form of
`<algorithm>:<hash>` or `<algorithm>_<hash>`, (or `sha256` in the form of
`<hash>`), should be used to lookup the alternatively mapped URI.

If the digest is provided in the form of `<hash>`, it will be assumed to be of algorithm type `sha256`.

The dependency mapping implementation in the project will continue to support the use of a `sha256` as long as the `sha256` `buildpack.toml` field is supported; however, users of this feature should ideally use a `checksum`.

### Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes Example
Using https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec with a `checksum` digest with a colon:
```
$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT
└── my-dependency-binding
    ├── type -> "dependency-mapping"
    ├── sha256:b4cb31162ff6d7926dd09e21551fa745fa3ae1758c25148b48dadcf78ab0c24c -> https://example.com/dep-1.tgz
    └── sha256:efa6d87993ff21615e2d8fc0c98e07ff357fc9f3b9bd93c2cf58ba7f2b6fd2e0 -> https://example.com/dep-2.tgz
```

Using https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec with a `checksum` digest with an underscore:
```
$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT
└── my-dependency-binding
    ├── type -> "dependency-mapping"
    ├── sha256_b4cb31162ff6d7926dd09e21551fa745fa3ae1758c25148b48dadcf78ab0c24c -> https://example.com/dep-1.tgz
    └── sha256_efa6d87993ff21615e2d8fc0c98e07ff357fc9f3b9bd93c2cf58ba7f2b6fd2e0 -> https://example.com/dep-2.tgz
```

With a `sha256` digest:
```
$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT
└── my-dependency-binding
    ├── type -> "dependency-mapping"
    ├── b4cb31162ff6d7926dd09e21551fa745fa3ae1758c25148b48dadcf78ab0c24c -> https://example.com/dep-1.tgz
    └── efa6d87993ff21615e2d8fc0c98e07ff357fc9f3b9bd93c2cf58ba7f2b6fd2e0 -> https://example.com/dep-2.tgz
```

### Deprecated: CNB Bindings Specification
The [legacy CNB binding
specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/extensions/bindings.md)
is deprecated as of May 2022 in favour of the Kubernetes binding specification
above. While the CNB binding specification is still supported, users should
adhere to the Kubernetes Binding spec instead.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Alternatively, open source users could package offline versions of the buildpacks. However, this requires knowledge and labor. Additionally, users who only consume a handful of dependencies may not want to pay the cost of downloading very large offline builder images that contain many dependencies that are irrelevant to their use case.

Another alternative would be for buildpacks to expose URI options for each dependency using environment configuration. However this may result in non-standard interfaces or incomplete support for URI mappings.

## Implementation

Before downloading a dependency the buildpack searches all bindings of type `dependency-mapping` for digests matches that of the target dependency. When the buildpack downloads a dependency it should use mapped URI instead of the URI in `buildpack.toml` if a mapping for the dependency exists.

`pack` already allows users to mount arbitrary directories in to the platform dir. `kpack` provides a dedicated UX for bindings. Other platforms are likely to follow suite.

## Addendums
- November 3, 2022: Modify RFC to leverage `checksum` for digest as well as a `sha256`
- November 3, 2022: The CNB binding specification is deprecated and while still supported, you should use the Service Binding specification for Kubernetes instead.
- October 12, 2023: Modify RFC to allow `checksum` dependency mappings to be passed in with a `_` instead of `:` to enable functionality on Kubernetes (`:` is not an allowed character).

# Paketo Buildpacks Alibaba Dragonwell Buildpack

## Summary

A [Alibaba Dragonwell Buildpack](https://github.com/eddumelendez/dragonwell) for supplying Alibaba's distribution of OpenJDK has been created by [@eddumelendez][@eddumelendez]. It is built using common tooling (libpak and libjvm) used by the Paketo Java sub-team and should be adopted into the Paketo Buildpacks Github Org.

## Motivation

We would like to move the Alibaba Dragonwell Buildpack into Paketo Buildpacks so that the community can use it to build Java applications, in particular on Alibaba Cloud. This will also give the buildpack maintainer the ability to leverage common Paketo tooling to keep the buildpack dependencies updated and release the buildpack.

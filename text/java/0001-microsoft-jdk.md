# Paketo Buildpacks Microsoft OpenJDK Buildpack

## Summary

A [Microsoft OpenJDK Buildpack](https://github.com/eddumelendez/microsoft-openjdk) for supplying Microsoft's distribution of OpenJDK has been created by [@eddumelendez][@eddumelendez]. It is built using common tooling (libpak and libjvm) used by the Paketo Java sub-team and should be adopted into the Paketo Buildpacks Github Org.

## Motivation

We would like to move the Microsoft OpenJDK Buildpack into the Paketo Buildpacks org so that the community can use it to build Java applications, in particular on Microsoft Azure. This will also give the buildpack maintainer the ability to leverage common Paketo tooling to keep the buildpack dependencies updated and release the buildpack.

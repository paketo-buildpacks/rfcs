# Leiningen (Clojure) Buildpack

## Summary

A [Leiningen][l] buildpack for building Clojure applications has been created [by the community][b].  It is based on the same technologies and is nearly indistinguishable from the other Paketo Buildpacks, especially the JVM build-system buildpacks, and it should be adopted into the project.

## Motivation
